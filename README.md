# Deep Learning-based Haemorrhage Segmentation in Retinal Images

This repository contains the experiments, trained models, and comparative results for my **Final Year Undergraduate Project**:  
**"Deep Learning-based Haemorrhage Segmentation in Retinal Images"**.

The purpose of this work is to design, train, and evaluate deep learning architectures capable of segmenting retinal haemorrhages from fundus photographs â€” an important step in the early detection and management of diabetic retinopathy and other ocular diseases.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents

- **Source code** for all experiments
- **Saved model files** (excluding the SAM model due to size constraints)
- **Visual and quantitative comparison results**
- **Notebooks and scripts** for training, evaluation, and visualisation

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented

The following architectures were explored and evaluated:

1. **U-Net**
2. **Attention U-Net**
3. **MultiRes U-Net**
4. **Custom U-Net proposed by Skouta et al.**
5. **Enhanced Custom U-Net with Attention Mechanisms**
6. **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** _(weights available separately)_

## ðŸ“Š Results & Comparisons

Please get in touch if you are interested in detailed results.

## ðŸ“¥ Trained Models

Due to their large file sizes, the **SAM model** weights are hosted externally.
All other trained models and results are included in this repository, and the complete set including the SAM outputs is accessible via the link below:
